I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at  The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), supervised by [Prof. Hongliang Ren](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/professors/prof-ren-hongliang). My research focuses on multimodal perception and localization based on magnetism for medical robots. I have published 11 papers in journals such as IEEE TII / TITS / TMECH, with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2Qkb_f8AAAAJ&hl'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. Additionally, I have experience working full-time at a research institute and two companies, providing me with industrial expertise in translating research into products. 

% During my five-year tenure at the Quanzhou Institute of Equipment Manufacturing (QIEM), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), I developed two prototype tracking systems based on permanent magnet and electromagnetic technologies. These systems attracted the interest of companies such as Huawei and Vivo, leading to negotiations for authorized applications in AR/VR devices (signed a contract with Vivo in 2023). I also collaborated with [Zhongke Lanjian Equipment Tech. Co., Ltd](http://www.zkljan.com/gsjj.html) to develop a logistics robot, providing magnetic and laser-based localization and navigation technologies. This collaboration transformed them from an integrator to an independent research and development company, with an annual turnover exceeding 200 million RMB.

% I have two full-time work experiences in industry, where I led the pre-research and promotion of a surface defect detection platform from scratch, under the project management mechanism of the company. The detection platform was successfully demonstrated in a textile enterprise. 

% I have actively bridged the gap between academia and industry, developing a software and hardware reconfigurable permanent magnet tracking system based on several years of academic research. This system has been successfully applied in five different applications. Notably, one of these applications, the Magnetic Gastrointestinal Dynamometer (MGD), is currently undergoing NMPA Class II medical device certification with our partner companies. The MGD is expected to revolutionize gastrointestinal dynamics diagnosis.
